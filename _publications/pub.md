<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

There is a rich literature on subject-object asymmetries in the acquisition of
relative clauses in monolingual children. Since Friedmann, Belletti and Rizzi’s
(2009) study on young typically developing (TD) children, work on relative
clause acquisition has focused on the role of so-called intervention effects in
explaining the difficulty with object relative clauses (henceforth, ORCs, as in (1)),
compared to subject relative clauses (2) (SRC).

(1) ORC: Show me the boy that the girl is pushing ____
(2) SRC: Show me the boy that ___ is pushing the girl

Subsequent work has largely supported Friedmann et al.’s initial hypothesis,
namely, that similarities between the head of the object relative clause (the boy in
(1)) and the embedded subject (the girl in (1), i.e., the intervener) lead to weak
ORC performance in young TD children (Adani, Stegenwallner-Schütz, & Niesel,
2017; Adani, van der Lely, Forgiarini, & Guasti, 2010; Bentea & Durrleman,
2018; Bentea, Durrleman, & Rizzi, 2016; Contemori & Belletti, 2014; Contemori
& Marinis, 2014). Moreover, work on individuals with developmental language
disorder (DLD) suggests that these learners can experience long-lasting
difficulties with such structures (Adani, Forgiarini, Guasti, & Lely, 2014;
Friedmann & Novogrodsky, 2011).

Compared to the work on monolingual children’s acquisition of relative
clauses, there are very few studies on the development of these structures in
bilingual children. The current paper thus seeks to fill this gap through the
examination of the comprehension of ORCs like (1) in sequential bilingual children (henceforth, L2 children). Given the importance of identifying DLD in
bilingual populations and the challenge that variation in language exposure
presents to this endeavor (e.g., Thordardottir & Brandeker, 2013), we focus on L2
children with very limited cumulative exposure to the L2 compared to the L1.
This focus will allow us to see whether object relative clauses, which are mastered
late in L1 acquisition, are also acquired late (i.e., after considerable L2 exposure)
in L2 children, or whether a different pattern emerges.
